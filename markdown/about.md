Hey, thanks for visiting my personal website.  
I am a new computer science graduate at *York University*. I was an active member of some clubs at York, where I contributed and practiced web development skills with my peers. Now I am seeking an employement in any tech position, hopefully full-stack/backend developer.

Some facts about me
 - Nothing beats **Coffee** ☕ and **Everything Bagel**
 - I cook when stressed 🍳
 - I tend to learn by practice 📚

I’m always excited to connect with others in the field, whether it’s to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, or just exchange ideas. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to chat!
