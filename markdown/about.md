Hi there, thank you for visiting my profile.
I am a recent graduate in Computer Science at York University. My journey began in backend development, where I gained hands-on experience building APIs and optimizing databases. But now I am excited to pivot into a world of Data Engineering. I’m currently deepening my knowledge in data pipelines, ETL processes, cloud platforms, and big data tools.

Summary of my skills:
- Programming Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java
- Data Engineering: ETL process, ETL pipeline
- Web frameworks: React.Js, Node.js, Express.js, FastAPI
- Data Science: Pandas, Numpy, Request
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- Cloud: AWS

Some facts about me
 - Nothing beats **Coffee** ☕ and **Everything Bagel**
 - I cook when stressed 🍳
 - I tend to learn by practice 📚

I’m always excited to connect with others in the field, whether it’s to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, or just exchange ideas. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to chat!
